problems with protein rni comparison... seems to not be rendering after the second search of ingredients... 
rni comparison for other nutrients work but not protein... the form data is not being lost... or is it that only the "rni_comparison" dict is being rendered?
when protein rni comparison was in index it was being calculated after form submission.. moved to fetch recipe
