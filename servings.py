# Function to estimate servings based on ingredient quantities and calories
def estimate_servings(ingredient_weights, total_calories):
    # Calculate total weight of ingredients
    total_weight = sum(ingredient_weights)

    standard_calories_per_serving = 500  # Adjust as needed
    
    # Estimate servings based on calories
